> Hugo theme for a secure, blazing fast and SEO-ready static website, using Bootstrap 5.

Open-source MIT Licensed Hugo Theme, using Bootstrap 5.

- 🛡️ Security aware

  As a frequent traveler with friends, I want to easily split expenses for accommodations, food, and activities, so I don’t have to manually track and calculate who owes what.

- ⚡ Fast by default

  As a restaurant-goer, I want to scan a receipt and assign items to individuals, so that each person only pays for what they ordered, including tax and tip.

- 📈 SEO-ready

  As a roommate sharing rent and utilities, I want to set up automatic recurring expense splits, so that we can fairly distribute monthly bills without constant manual calculations.

Check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/filipecarneiro/hugo-bootstrap-theme) for the release notes.
